% [F0_vector,Xi_F,Xi_Z] = ssfp_epg_domain_fplus_fminus (N,alpha,TR,T1,T2)
% 
% Calculates the Extended Phase Graph (EPG) for some variants of gradient echo (GE) / steady state free precession (SSFP) sequences
% The particular type of the (idealized) GE/SSFP is specified in the hard coded settings below
% This code uses the Fourier based EPG domains F+(+k), F-(-k), Z(+k), see the mentioned review paper below
% 
% IN :  N    : Number of Repetitions of RF flip angles (= number of RF excitation pulses for one given flip angle alpha)
%       alpha: Constant flip angle or flip angle array of RF excitation pulses in deg to be repeated N times
%       TR   : Repetition time, same unit as T1,T2
%       T1   : Longitudinal relaxation time, same unit as TR,T2
%       T2   : Transverse relaxation time, same unit as TR,T1
% 
% OUT:  F0_vector: Vector of resulting F0 states ("echo intensities")
%       Xi_F     : State evolution matrix of all transverse F states (immediately after the RF pulse in each case)
%       Xi_Z     : State evolution matrix of all longitudinal Z states (immediately after the RF pulse in each case)

% Studying and using this code means to acknowledge Matthias Weigel's months of cursing and weeping ...  ;-)
% ... by citing the above mentioned review paper. Thank you :-)

% Further comments in regard to the code:
% - For transverse magnetization, this code works in both the F+ and F- domain   --   see EPG-R, particularly the comments in the "software coding section"
%   Therefore, both the F+(0) and F-(0) state are assessed (Omega matrix), however, only the F+(0) state is stored in the state evolution matrix Xi (F-(0) is superfluous)
%   One could see it as the "natural approach in regard to the T-matrix"   --   or not ;-)
% - This code is only roughly optimized for speed or for efficiency: a dedicated code (particularly in C++) would be much faster; and also quite shorter without the "gadgets"
% - This code does not consider any TE effects
% - This code automatically uses an initial alpha/2 pulse for alternating flip angles (you can change that, of course, like everything ...)
% - This code was roughly validated by comparing selected examples with ...
%           ... a "dedicated Bloch simulation" for FISP, FLASH, TRUFI
%           ... the software "ssfp_epg_domain_fplus_alone.m" for FISP, FLASH, TRUFI
