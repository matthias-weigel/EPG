% [F0_vector,Xi_F,Xi_Z,Xi_F_all,Xi_Z_all] = cp_cpmg_epg_domain_fplus_fminus (N,alpha,ESP,T1,T2)
% 
% Calculates the Extended Phase Graph (EPG) over one TR / one echo train for multi spin echo (multi SE) sequences obeying the Carr-Purcell (CP) or Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) conditions
% The particular type (CP/CPMG) of the (idealized) spin echo sequence is specified in the hard coded settings below
% Common CPMG based imaging sequences have acronyms such as SE, TSE, FSE or RARE.
% This code uses the Fourier based EPG domains F+(+k), F-(-k), Z(+k), see the mentioned review paper below
% 
% IN :  N    : Number of Repetitions of RF refocusing flip angles (= number of RF refocusing pulses for one given flip angle alpha)
%       alpha: Constant flip angle or flip angle array of RF refocusing pulses in deg to be repeated N times
%       ESP  : Echo spacing (or refocusing RF spacing), same unit as T1,T2
%       T1   : Longitudinal relaxation time, same unit as ESP,T2
%       T2   : Transverse relaxation time, same unit as ESP,T1
% 
% OUT:  F0_vector: Vector of resulting F0 states ("echo intensities")
%       Xi_F     : State evolution matrix of all transverse F states at each echo time (only the states generating the primary pathways that can only be measured)
%       Xi_Z     : State evolution matrix of all longitudinal Z states at each echo time (only the states generating the primary pathways that can only be measured)
%       Xi_F_all : State evolution matrix of all transverse F states after each refocusing pulse and at each echo time (in alternating order, includes also the 'hidden' secondary pathway states - see e.g. EPG-R)
%       Xi_Z_all : State evolution matrix of all longitudinal Z states after each refocusing pulse and at each echo time (in alternating order, includes also the 'hidden' secondary pathway states - see e.g. EPG-R)

% Studying and using this code means to acknowledge Matthias Weigel's months of cursing and weeping ...  ;-)
% ... by citing the above mentioned review paper. Thank you :-) 
% 
% Intentionally built on my software "ssfp_epg_domain_fplus_fminus.m" (for FISP, FLASH, TRUFI, ...)
% 
% 
% Further comments in regard to the code:
% - For transverse magnetization, this code works in both the F+ and F- domain   --   see EPG-R, particularly the comments in the "software coding section"
%   Therefore, both the F+(0) and F-(0) state are assessed (in the Omega matrix), however, only the F+(0) state is stored in the evolution matrix Xi (F-(0) is superfluous)
% - This code is only roughly optimized for speed or for efficiency: a dedicated code (particularly in C++) would be much faster; and also quite shorter without the "gadgets"
% - This code was roughly validated by comparing selected examples with ...
%           ... known examples & the review paper EPG-R
%           ... historical C++ code of mine
%           ... the software "cp_cpmg_epg_domain_freal.m" for CP and CPMG based sequences
