# EPG
The extended phase graph (EPG) concept utilizes a Fourier based magnetization description in terms of so called *configurations states* for depicting and understanding magnetization response in MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) in both a pictorial and quantitative way.
A detailed introduction to the topic including a broader overview of EPGs - considered being helpful by many readers - can be found in [Weigel M. J Magn Reson Imaging 2015. DOI:10.1002/jmri.24619](https://doi.org/10.1002/jmri.24619).

## The EPG codes

The available codes represent basic programming examples for multi spin-echo (CP, CPMG, TSE, FSE, RARE, ...)  as well as steady state free precession (SSFP, FLASH, FISP, GRASS, FAST, ...) based MR sequences. These are the original codes that resided at the website [http://epg.matthias-weigel.net](http://epg.matthias-weigel.net) in the years 2015 to 2018 - until they had to be removed including some additional services due to GDPR issues with the European Union. After that the codes were sent via email on request.

In the first 3.5 years between 2015 and 2018, the EPG codes were downloaded 715 times from the website, and there is still a continuing interest in the source codes. The author would have *never expected* this success even in his wildest dreams and feels really honored. As a consequence, the original codes are provided in this GitHub repository now.

### Request for Citing

The present example codes essentially belong to the above mentioned manuscript by [M. Weigel](https://doi.org/10.1002/jmri.24619). If you find them useful, please, cite [this repository](https://github.com/matthias-weigel/EPG) and also include a reference to the associated, basic manuscript [Weigel M. J Magn Reson Imaging 2015;41:266-295. DOI:10.1002/jmri.24619](https://doi.org/10.1002/jmri.24619).

Thanks a lot!
